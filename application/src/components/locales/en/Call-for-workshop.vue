    <p>
        CLIHC tutorials and workshops are in-depth presentations of fundamental or state-of-the-art topics presented
        by researchers or practitioners within the field of HCI. The tutorials and workshops empower attendees to
        learn new skills and offer possibilities to meet new people and discuss topics of shared interest. The scope
        for tutorials and workshops is broad and includes topics, such as new technologies, research approaches and
        methodologies, design practices, user/consumer insights, investigations into new
        services/applications/interfaces, statistics, and much more. Virtual or Augmented Reality, wearable
        computing, and generally applications with technology on the go in mind are highly recommended.
    </p>
    <p>
        A tutorial and workshop should focus on its topic in detail and include references to the "must-read" papers
        or materials within its domain. A participatory approach in which the tutorial participants actively engage
        in exercises is welcomed, though not required. The expected audience will vary in terms of prior knowledge,
        but will largely consist of researchers, PhD students, practitioners, and educators. Tutorial and workshop
        proposal submissions by members of the industry are welcomed as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        The overall conference theme in 2023 is Culture and Artificial Intelligence, so we invite tutorials and
        workshop to discuss ethical aspects in their work, as part of their problem definitions, system design,
        experiment design, instrument and metric adoption and conclusions.

        authors to propose a program committee
