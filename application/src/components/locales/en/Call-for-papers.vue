    <p>
        The <a href="https://clihc2026.laihc.org/" class="uline">XII Latin American Conference on Human-Computer Interaction (CLIHC 2026)</a>, aims
        to provide a premier forum that brings together the Latin American and
        international Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research communities to discuss and
        share ideas, methods, approaches, and techniques for designing, implementing, and
        evaluating interactive user experiences. In accordance with previous editions, we
        believe that HCI must foster the production of technology that can be used by and
        benefit as many people as possible, enabling intercultural exchange and
        cooperation between people with different backgrounds and needs.
    </p>

    <p>
        This year, CLIHC 2026 will take place in two cities, Aracaju/Brazil and
        Oaxaca/Mexico. However, the
        <strong
            >presentation of the full papers will only take place in the satellite city of
            Aracaju, Brazil</strong
        >. For now, is open to submissions in the following category:

    </ul>

    <p>
        Authors are invited to prepare and submit papers reporting on research projects,
        innovative designs, user studies, models of interaction, field studies, case
        studies, and others. Academics, researchers, practitioners and professionals from
        industry, as well as undergraduate and graduate students are welcome to
        participate in the peer-reviewed selection of the works that will be presented at
        the conference, from May 06 to 08, 2026.

    <h3>Submission Categories</h3>

    <h4>Full Papers (15 Pages)</h4>
    <p>
        Research projects that have achieved a mature stage and present an original
        contribution to the state of the art are welcome to submit in the full paper
        category. Submissions must be relevant to the subject of the conference, and may
        not have been published nor be under review in any other conference or journal.
        The maximum length for full papers is
        <strong>15 pages including references</strong>, and papers must be written in
        English, Portuguese, or Spanish.
    </p>

    <p>
        The papers will be reviewed by at least two reviewers in a double-anonymous
        process. Please note that submitted papers must be anonymized, including
        references to the authors’ own previous work.
    </p>

    <p>
        We are working to ensure that accepted papers will be published in the SBC OpenLib
        (SOL) (a digital library maintained by the Brazilian Computer Society - SBC). In
        addition, best papers will be recommended for submitting an extended version and
        be published in a special edition that we are negotiating with a prestigious HCI
        or Computer Science journal.
