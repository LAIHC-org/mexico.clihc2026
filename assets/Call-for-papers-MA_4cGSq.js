In accordance with previous editions, we believe that HCI must foster the production of technology that can be used by and benefit as many people as possible, enabling intercultural exchange and cooperation between people with different backgrounds and needs. </p><p> This year, CLIHC 2026 will take place in two cities, Aracaju/Brazil and Oaxaca/Mexico. However, the <strong>presentation of the full papers will only take place in the satellite city of Aracaju, Brazil</strong>. For now, is open to submissions in the following category: </p><ul><li>Full papers</li></ul><p> Authors are invited to prepare and submit papers reporting on research projects, innovative designs, user studies, models of interaction, field studies, case studies, and others.
